## Overview

This repository presents the foundational mathematical theory of **Base-e Spiral Functions** and their role in unifying geometric, quantum, and information-theoretic structures. The work introduces a novel mathematical language that bridges traditionally separate domains of physics and mathematics.

### Core Mathematical Hypothesis

All physical structures emerge from interference patterns of spiral functions defined as:

$$\Phi_\mu(x) = A_\mu \cdot e^{-\alpha_\mu x_\mu} \cdot \exp\left(2\pi i \cdot \ln x_\mu\right)$$

The induced metric tensor arises from complex function interference:

$$g_{\mu\nu}(x) = \text{Re}\left[\Phi_\mu(x) \cdot \overline{\Phi_\nu(x)}\right]$$

### Four Fundamental Properties

1. **Exponential Decay**: $|\Phi_\mu(x)| = |A_\mu| \cdot e^{-\alpha_\mu x_\mu}$
2. **Logarithmic Phase Rotation**: $\arg(\Phi_\mu(x)) = \arg(A_\mu) + 2\pi \ln x_\mu$
3. **Multiplicative Periodicity**: Exists only when $\alpha_\mu = 0$ and $\lambda = e^k$
4. **Scale Covariance**: $\Phi_\mu(\lambda x) = \lambda^{2\pi i} \Phi_\mu(x) \cdot e^{-\alpha_\mu(\lambda-1)x}$
